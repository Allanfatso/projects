# Mini Network Security Project - Zone-Based Firewall with IDS & SSH
Project Overview
This project focuses on securing a network through the implementation of a functional zone-based firewall, 
Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and SSH configuration. 
The network setup is designed to enhance security by creating different zones for various types of traffic, 
each protected by appropriate firewall rules. The IDS is used to monitor and analyze network traffic for 
signs of suspicious activity, while SSH is configured to ensure secure remote access to network devices.
