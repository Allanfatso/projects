# Weather Forecast Application

This project is a weather forecast app that retrieves live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API 
and optimizes performance through server-side and browser caching. The app first implements basic 
weather data retrieval and displays key information such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. 
It then incorporates server-side caching with PHP and MySQL to reduce unnecessary API calls, 
followed by browser caching using the JavaScript localStorage API to avoid excessive network or server access.
This ensures the app delivers a seamless user experience by minimizing delays and improving efficiency.

The app's architecture is documented with UML deployment diagrams that showcase the evolution of the system, 
from the initial client-side structure to the final version with integrated server and browser caching.
