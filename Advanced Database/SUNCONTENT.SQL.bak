/*
a. Some Modules may not have any Students allocated yet.
b. There may be some Students who have yet to enrol on a Module.
c. Some Courses may be new and not have any Students taking it.
d. A Student must be registered on a Course.
e. The test data should be appropriate to the queries requested (that 
is, no query should return “no rows retrieved”). 
Give  thought  to  what  data  should  be  added.  As  a  minimum,  each  table 
should have at least 5 rows in it, but some should be more, for example, 
you  may  have  5  modules,  but  each  module  should  have  at  least  5-6 
students  enrolled  on  it.  Basically,  the  tables  at  the  many  end  of  a 
relationship should therefore contain more data than the relation at the one 
end.
