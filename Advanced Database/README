# University Results and Course Enrollment System

This project implements a database system for SUN University to track student module results and
their enrollment in courses. The system includes tables for students, modules, and course enrollments, 
as well as views to provide detailed reports on student performance. The database schema supports 
complex relationships between students and their enrolled modules, tracking assessment components 
such as portfolios, coursework, exams, and practicals, with individual weightings. Triggers are used 
to audit changes to module results, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized actions like
deletions or incorrect updates to overall marks. Additionally, audit trails are created for every
modification, capturing the old and new values of results, components, and status changes.

The project also explores database security techniques, including the use of triggers for auditing 
and preventing unauthorized access or manipulation of data. Fine-grained auditing is discussed as 
an alternative to traditional triggers, providing more flexibility and less performance overhead. 
This approach allows for detailed monitoring of database activity, capturing not only DML actions but 
also SQL execution and result sets, which improves the system's forensic capabilities. 
The system is designed with scalability in mind, but performance considerations such as trigger overhead 
and fine-grained auditing are key aspects of the implementation.
