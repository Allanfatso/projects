# Traffic Light Sensor System

This project develops a traffic light sensor system that detects when cars pass through a red light 
or move beyond a certain distance without the use of cameras. It uses an ultrasonic distance sensor 
to measure the car's proximity to the traffic light and a PIR sensor that activates when a car is 
within range. The system includes two Arduino boards to process inputs and control outputs, with LEDs 
simulating traffic lights (red, yellow, green) and an LCD display to warn about violations. The goal 
is to enhance road safety on busy or accident-prone roads by detecting and signaling traffic offenses in real time.

The program is split into two parts: one handles the sensor inputs (ultrasonic and PIR), while the other controls 
the LCD display and LED traffic lights. Despite some performance limitations due to the Arduino's memory capacity, 
the system correctly detects cars passing the red light and classifies it as a violation when the car moves beyond 
the set distance. Although the LCD display couldn't show results due to memory constraints, the serial monitor provides 
the necessary feedback. This setup can be useful in real-time monitoring systems for high-traffic areas.
